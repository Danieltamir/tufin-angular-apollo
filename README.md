# Tufin & Angular IL FrontEnd Meetup Demo Application
This application is the demo application we saw in the meetup about:

Apollo Angular and GraphQL Integration.

1.Clone the repository
2.Run `npm install` under the main folder.
3.Run `npm run server` in order to run the Apollo Mock server.
4.Under the Angular application folder, run `ng serve` and play with it!

In order to run GraphiQL after running the server, go to http://localhost:4000/graphql

Enjoy!
